## Goal:
Use AI image generator, [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), for images as inspiration for "recreating Ghibli world" -> My ideal environment art scene.

## What is ChatGPT?
- ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI.
## What It‚Äôs For: ‚Üí Problem solving
- ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of tasks, including answering questions, providing explanations, generating creative content, and engaging in conversation.
## Creative Application: ‚Üí **Problem**
- My ideal environment art scene, for images as inspiration for "recreating Ghibli world".


## Experiments Process:
1. Chat with ChatGPT for get inspirations for setting up my environment art scene
2. I **feed in my screenshot** of Pinterest collection
	- ![|500](https://i.imgur.com/aDxTvUg.jpeg)

3. The result I get
	1. #1 First Image Result
	- ![[DALL¬∑E 2024-11-05 11.02.12 - A fantasy game scene inspired by lush, enchanted forests, featuring a vibrant path surrounded by glowing mushrooms and towering trees. The atmosphere .webp| 500]]
	- Interestingly this is actually quite similar to the scene I made in UE5
	- (I made the scene before I get the AI generated image)
	- ![| 500](https://i.imgur.com/CSnyPyx.png)
		- Placing these two images together helps me see how much more detail I need for my ideal game scene, which is really helpful!
		- I can see how much better AI tools have become lately.
		- üí° Next Step: I wish I could use AI to create a 3D scene. 


4. Feed in visual description to ChatGPT: 
	1. **ME**: If I want to create a ghibli style environment art focused game scene what will you suggest?
	2. **ChatGPT**: **Environmental Storytelling**: Ghibli scenes tell a story through objects and the placement of details. Add tiny ‚Äúlived-in‚Äù touches like small furniture in the forest, hidden doorways, abandoned wells, or mystical markings to evoke curiosity.
	3. **ME**: create an image for me: Ghibli style - Environmental Storytelling: Ghibli scenes tell a story through objects and the placement of details. Add tiny ‚Äúlived-in‚Äù touches like small furniture in the forest, hidden doorways, abandoned wells, or mystical markings to evoke curiosity.

### Helpful tips from Chat
I asked: "give me some key elements from ghibli style"
1. **Focus on Nature and Scale**: Ghibli films often highlight nature's beauty. Use large, towering trees, lush foliage, and intricate natural details. Think about how to add layers of depth in the landscape, making the player feel small yet part of a larger world.
2. **Soft Lighting and Color Palette**: Soft, warm lighting, especially at dusk or dawn, can create a sense of calm and magic. Ghibli colors tend to be warm and earthy, so go for pastel greens, blues, and warm browns. Subtle gradients in lighting and shadows can add that magical touch.
3. **Environmental Storytelling**: Ghibli scenes tell a story through objects and the placement of details. Add tiny ‚Äúlived-in‚Äù touches like small furniture in the forest, hidden doorways, abandoned wells, or mystical markings to evoke curiosity.

## Observation & Conclusion
The image feels surreal and distinctly AI-generated. I noticed the high saturation and the wide variety of textures, which, while visually rich, create an unbalanced feel‚Äîlikely due to the diverse set of images used to train the model.
- For example, in the third image, the details can be overwhelming, making it hard for the viewer to find a focal point. While the richness is impressive, it can feel excessive. However, these generated images are undoubtedly incredible references for future project settings.
- I wonder if I can get multiple like around 5-10 images generated each time, have the keywords of elements in the image below and then upscale an image, and get more similar style images generated.

## Next Step
1. The whole process of exploring new images reminds me of [[W09 -|Weighted Selection]]...
2. **Use AI to create a 3D scene**
