## 2️⃣ - Consciousness, Intelligence, Creativity - Oct 29, 2024
> Class Slides: [Consciousness, Intelligence, Creativity](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yRoHfmqOTld1dwjNQsDdNNR4XmXRTelvtffB7AjXy24/edit?usp=sharing)

- **1. Consciousness**
    
    - **Human Consciousness**: awareness of self, free will
    - Key points:
        - Automatic reactions vs. self-awareness and having choices, or “free will”
        - Daniel Dennett's _Dangerous Idea_ on AI autonomy and cultural values
        - Do AIs have free will?
    - Relevant questions:
        - Can machines have consciousness?
        - Do machines have the right to knowledge?
        - Can we create consciousness for bots?

- **2. Intelligence**
    
    - **AI = Intelligence on demand**: Ability to acquire and apply knowledge, measurable externally
    - Key points:
        - AI vs. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
        - AGI has more autonomy, closer to human intelligence, while current AI operates within pre-set limits
    - Relevant questions:
        - How does autonomy in AGI differ from current AI systems?

- **3. Creativity**
    
    - **Creativity** (definition): The use of imagination or original ideas in artistic works
    - Key points:
        - Inspiration → Creation → **Curation** (ability to integrate, editorial skills, aesthetic judgment)
        - More accessibility: Allowing people to access skills they lack
    - Relevant questions:
        - Is creativity important in AI?

- **1. Working with Parameters**
    
    **Basic Parameters**:
    
    - **1. Aspect Ratio**
        - Usually it being trained in Landscape or Portrait.
    - **2. Steps**
        - The number of iterative steps the model takes to generate an image.
            - **Effect**:
                - **Lower Steps**: Faster generation but may lack detail.
                - **Higher Steps**: Slower but produces more detailed and refined outputs.
    - **3. Guidance Scale**
        - Listen to my instructions.
    - **4. Negative Prompt**
        - What is not expected in the generated version.
    - **5. Seed**
        - Same seed: Output same result.
- **2. Helpful Tools**
    
    - **Image Generator**: [Mage.space](https://www.mage.space/)
