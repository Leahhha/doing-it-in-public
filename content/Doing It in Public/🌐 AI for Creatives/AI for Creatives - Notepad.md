- **1. Consciousness**
    
    - **Human Consciousness**: awareness of self, free will
    - Key points:
        - Automatic reactions vs. self-awareness and having choices, or “free will”
        - Daniel Dennett's _Dangerous Idea_ on AI autonomy and cultural values
        - Do AIs have free will?
    - Relevant questions:
        - Can machines have consciousness?
        - Do machines have the right to knowledge?
        - Can we create consciousness for bots?

- **2. Intelligence**
    
    - **AI = Intelligence on demand**: Ability to acquire and apply knowledge, measurable externally
    - Key points:
        - AI vs. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
        - AGI has more autonomy, closer to human intelligence, while current AI operates within pre-set limits
    - Relevant questions:
        - How does autonomy in AGI differ from current AI systems?

- **3. Creativity**
    
    - **Creativity** (definition): The use of imagination or original ideas in artistic works
    - Key points:
        - Inspiration → Creation → **Curation** (ability to integrate, editorial skills, aesthetic judgment)
        - More accessibility: Allowing people to access skills they lack
    - Relevant questions:
        - Is creativity important in AI?
