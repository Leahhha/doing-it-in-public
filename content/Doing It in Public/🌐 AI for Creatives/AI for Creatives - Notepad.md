## 1. Consciousness

- **Human Consciousness**: awareness of self, free will
    - Automatic reactions vs. self-awareness and having choices, or “free will”
- **Daniel Dennett** _Dangerous Idea_:
    - Dangerous to give AI too much autonomy unless they can recognize cultural values.
    - Do AIs have free will?
- Questions to consider:
    - **Machine consciousness**: Can matter be conscious?
    - **Right to be informed**: Do machines have a right to knowledge?
    - **Creating consciousness for bots**: Is it possible or ethical?

## 2. Intelligence

- **AI = Intelligence on demand**:
    - Ability to acquire and apply knowledge, measurable externally
- **AI vs. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
    - **Autonomy**: AGI has more autonomy, closer to human intelligence, while current AI operates within pre-set limits.

## 3. Creativity

- **Creativity** (dictionary definition):
    - The use of imagination or original ideas, especially in artistic works.
- **Is creativity important?**
    - Inspiration → Creation → **Curation** (ability to integrate everything, editorial skills, aesthetic judgment)
- **More accessibility**:
    - Filling in gaps where humans lack certain skills, providing people with easy access to creativity tools.
